# 🖥️ Getting Started

This folder contains the introductory materials and exercises for **CS 5001 – Intensive Foundations of Computer Science**.  
The goal of this module is to build a foundation for designing and understanding solutions to computational problems.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the process of solving problems on a computer  
- Identify the characteristics of an algorithm in computer science  
- Interpret and draw flowcharts as graphical representations of algorithms  
- Use the interactive Python shell to experiment with simple expressions  
- Write and run a simple Python program using a `main()` function  

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- Introduction to algorithms and flowcharts  
- Understanding computational problem-solving  
- Basic syntax and structure of Python programs  
- Interactive programming using the Python shell  

---

## 🪄 Notes
This is where the journey begins — understanding not just *how* to code, but *how to think like a computer scientist.*  
Start small, test often, and get comfortable experimenting in the Python shell.
