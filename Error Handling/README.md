# ⚠️ Error Handling
This folder contains exercises and examples related to **error handling** and **defensive programming**.  
As programs become more complex, it’s essential to design them to handle unexpected inputs, file issues, and runtime errors gracefully.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Validate **function parameters** and **keyboard input** using defensive programming techniques  
- Handle errors that occur during program execution by taking appropriate corrective actions  
- Explain how program execution progresses when errors are raised  
- Write programs that **read from** and **write to** simple text files  
- Identify and describe the different types of errors that might occur during file operations  

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- Defensive programming principles  
- The `try` / `except` / `finally` structure  
- Common Python exceptions  
- Input validation and error messages  
- File I/O operations and related errors

## 🪄 Notes
Error handling is what separates fragile programs from reliable ones.  
Writing code that expects the unexpected — and recovers gracefully — is a mark of a thoughtful, professional developer.
