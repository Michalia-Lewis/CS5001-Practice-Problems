# 🗂️ Dictionaries & Sets

This folder contains exercises and examples focused on **dictionaries** and **sets**, two fundamental data structures in Python that enable efficient data storage and retrieval.  
These structures allow programs to organize data for faster lookups, reduce redundancy, and improve problem-solving efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Describe the characteristics and use cases of **dictionaries** and **sets**  
- Determine when a dictionary or set is the appropriate structure for a given problem  
- Design and implement programs that effectively use dictionaries and sets to store and manipulate data  

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- Introduction to data structures in programming  
- Key-value mapping with `dict` objects  
- Unordered collections and uniqueness with `set` objects  
- Common operations and methods for dictionaries and sets  
- Choosing the right data structure for a problem

## 🪄 Notes
Dictionaries and sets are like the Swiss Army knives of data storage — fast, flexible, and perfect for tackling real-world problems efficiently.  
Once you master these, you’ll start seeing them everywhere in your code.
