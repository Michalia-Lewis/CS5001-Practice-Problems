# CS 5001 â€“ Practice Problems

This repository contains my practice problems and exercises for **CS 5001: Intensive Foundations of Computer Science**.  
It serves as a space to strengthen my understanding of programming concepts through hands-on problem solving and experimentation.

## ðŸ§  Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Develop stronger **problem-solving** and **algorithmic thinking** skills  
- Reinforce key **Python programming** concepts  
- Document progress and learning throughout the course
