# ðŸ§µ Strings and Lists

This folder contains exercises and examples exploring **sequences** in Python â€” focusing on **strings** and **lists** as core data structures.  
Sequences allow programs to store, access, and manipulate collections of data efficiently.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the different types of **sequences** commonly used in programming: **lists**, **strings**, and **tuples**  
- Explain the difference between **mutable** and **immutable** objects  
- Design and implement solutions to problems that use **sequences**  

---

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered
- Sequence types in Python (`list`, `string`, `tuple`)  
- Indexing, slicing, and iterating through sequences  
- Mutability and data manipulation  
- Building programs that process collections of data

## ðŸª„ Notes
Sequences are everywhere â€” from the text you type to the data you analyze.  
Understanding how to store, modify, and traverse them lays the groundwork for more
