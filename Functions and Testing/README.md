# ðŸ§® Functions and Testing

This folder contains materials and exercises that focus on **functions** â€” the building blocks of organized, reusable, and testable code.  
Youâ€™ll learn how to define, call, and test functions to make your programs cleaner and more efficient.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Explain what a **function** is and when to use one  
- Define the key parts of a function, including **arguments**, **parameters**, and **return values**  
- Call a function, providing any required input and using its output  
- Design and write simple, purposeful functions  
- Implement **tests** to debug functions by comparing expected vs. actual values

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered
- Function definition and syntax  
- Arguments and parameters  
- Return statements and scope  
- Modular programming and code reuse  
- Writing and running basic tests
