# 🔁 while Loops

This folder contains exercises and examples focused on **iteration** using the `while` loop — one of the fundamental building blocks of algorithm design.  
Iteration allows a program to repeat a sequence of statements until a specific condition is met, enabling dynamic and efficient control of program flow.

## 🪄 Notes
Loops are what make programs come alive — repeating actions, handling dynamic input, and making automation possible.  
The key here: always double-check your exit condition. Nobody likes an infinite loop (unless you’re *really* into de
