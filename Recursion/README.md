# 🔁 Recursion
This folder contains exercises and examples introducing the concept of **recursion** — a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller parts of a larger problem.  
Recursion provides an alternative to iteration and helps simplify complex problems into elegant, repeatable patterns.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Define **recursion** and identify the structural parts of a recursive solution  
- Design and implement recursive solutions from problem descriptions  
- Translate problems between **iterative** and **recursive** solutions  
- Debug and analyze problems that have been solved recursively  

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- The structure of a recursive function (base case and recursive case)  
- Common recursive patterns and examples  
- Comparing recursion and iteration  
- Tracing recursive calls and understanding the call stack  
- Debugging recursion and preventing infinite recursion  

---

## 🪄 Notes
Recursion is both a logic puzzle and a mindset — once you understand how a problem can solve itself in smaller steps, you start to think like the computer.  
Remember: **every recursive function needs a base case**, or it might keep calling itself forever.
