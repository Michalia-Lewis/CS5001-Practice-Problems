# 🧱 Classes & Objects
This folder contains exercises and examples introducing **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.  
While previous modules used objects, this module goes “under the hood” to show how objects and classes are actually defined and implemented.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Distinguish between a **class** and an **object**  
- Implement simple classes by defining **attributes** and **methods**, including constructors and string methods  
- Define and use constructors, functions, and methods with **optional parameters**  
- Develop classes that inherit from **`TestCase`** to test other classes and functions  

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- Class definitions and object instantiation  
- Instance attributes vs. methods  
- Constructors (`__init__`) and string methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`)  
- Optional parameters and method flexibility  
- Writing tests using classes that inherit from `unittest.TestCase`

## 🪄 Notes
Object-oriented programming lets you create your own custom data types — things that bundle data *and* behavior together.  
Understanding classes is a major step toward writing clean, scalable, real-world software.
