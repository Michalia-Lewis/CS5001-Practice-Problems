# ðŸ’¡ Boolean Expressions & Conditionals

This folder contains exercises and examples for **Boolean logic, variables, and conditional statements** in Python.  
We explore how computers represent and manipulate data, make decisions, and control the flow of a program.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Explain what a **variable** is and write statements that assign values  
- Distinguish between Pythonâ€™s basic data types: **integers**, **floats**, and **strings**  
- Manipulate variables using **arithmetic operators** to perform calculations  
- Follow standard conventions for **naming variables** and **writing readable code**  
- Define and use **Boolean expressions**  
- Write Boolean expressions using **relational** and **equality operators**  
- Define and apply **logical operators**: `and`, `or`, and `not`  
- Evaluate complex Boolean expressions using **truth tables**  
- Write and trace **conditional statements** in Python with `if`, `elif`, and `else`

## ðŸª„ Notes
This module introduces the heart of decision-making in programming â€” teaching computers to think in *true* and *false*.  
Mastering conditionals means youâ€™re one step closer to writing programs that can make smart, dynamic choices.
