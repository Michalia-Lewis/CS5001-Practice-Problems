# ðŸ”‚ for Loops

This folder contains exercises and examples on **for loops**, one of Pythonâ€™s most powerful tools for iteration.  
The `for` loop provides a concise way to repeat actions over sequences, ranges, and collections of data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Evaluate code that iterates using a **for loop**  
- Differentiate between the three ways of calling the **`range()`** function  
- Construct **for loops** that iterate over a set of values or a sequence  
- Compare **for** and **while** loops and convert one form to another  
- Choose between iterating over the **elements** of a sequence and iterating over its **indices**  

---

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered
- The structure and syntax of `for` loops  
- Using `range()` to control iteration  
- Iterating over sequences, strings, and lists  
- Loop conversions: `while` â†” `for`  
- Best practices for clean, readable iteration  

---

## ðŸª„ Notes
`for` loops are the backbone of efficient iteration â€” elegant, readable, and built for speed.  
Once you master them, repetitive tasks start feeling like second nature (and a lot less tedious).
